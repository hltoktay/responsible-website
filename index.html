	<h2>Bookkeepers in London</h2>
	<p>Surveys suggest that for an average small business, financial paperwork and records can take up as much as 20% of available work time. For most businesses that time could be far more productively spent on customer facing matters, product or service development or marketing.<br>
The question is, can your business afford a bookkeeper? Additionally, is it better to have a bookkeeper and an accountant, is it necessary and are the roles separate and different?</p>
